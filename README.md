# LinkSpot
Linkspot is a platform to share specific links for the public to get any content for free. Users can sign in using their Gmail, sign-in
post a new link, sign out. Role-based authorization is made so that the admin can monitor the links being submitted by a user and approve them. The users can view any link
without signing in and can filter based on the category of the link (eg. online courses). Used C# as the primary language with .NET Framework 4.7 as the backend, MS SQL Server as DB,
Bootstrap as the front end with Brutalism as the design. Deployed to Azure.
